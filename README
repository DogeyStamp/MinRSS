MinRSS
======
MinRSS (minimal RSS) is an RSS feed reader inspired by suckless.org's
IRC clients ii and sic. Instead of presenting RSS articles as entries
in a menu, it saves them as files in folders.

rss
|--news
|  |--article1
|  `--article2
`--blog
  |--post
  `--other_post

Requirements
------------
You need libcurl and libxml2 to compile MinRSS.

Installation
------------
Run this command as root to build MinRSS:

	make clean install

Configuration
-------------
MinRSS is configured via the config.h file, which you can create by
either compiling MinRSS for the first time or copying config.def.h
to it. To save your changes, recompile MinRSS.

Using MinRSS
------------
Make a directory to store you RSS feeds, then cd into it. Then, enter 
the minrss command to download the RSS feeds. Your feeds will be 
available as folders in your current working directory.
